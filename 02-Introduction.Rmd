Tropical rainforests have fascinated ecologists due to their outstanding diversity [@connell_diversity_1978].

Tropical forests are primary ecosystems in terms of biodiversit and carbon storage [@Lewis2004].

High biodiversity from tropical rainforests is the source of many ecosystem functions, which support ecosystem services.

Biodiversity and ecosystem functionning field is emmering [@Loreau2000].

Selective logging is increasing in tropical forests.

Tropical logging accounts for one eight of global timber production [@Blaser2011].

Selective logging represents a major threat to biodiversity [@Gibson2013].
