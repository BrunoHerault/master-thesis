["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Introduce why tropical rainforest are such a good study case Define biodiversity Define ecosystem functionning Define ecosystem services Introduce tropical sylviculture Define selective logging Introduce biodiversity erosion in tropical rainforests ant its impact Introduce Loreau partitionning Introduce the interest of modelling Introduce the idea to look at biodiversity as both a parameter and an output Tropical rainforests have fascinated ecologists due to their outstanding diversity (Connell 1978). Tropical forests are primary ecosystems in terms of biodiversit and carbon storage (Lewis et al. 2004). High biodiversity from tropical rainforests is the source of many ecosystem functions, which support ecosystem services. Biodiversity and ecosystem functionning field is emmering (Loreau 2000). Selective logging is increasing in tropical forests. Tropical logging accounts for one eight of global timber production (Blaser et al. 2011). Selective logging represents a major threat to biodiversity (Gibson et al. 2013). References "],
