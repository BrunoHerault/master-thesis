["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Sutainable forest management in the tropics (i.e. managed selective harvesting of timber) has been widely promoted internationnaly to combat tropical deforestation and degradation (Zimmerman &amp; Kormos 2012). Currently tropical logging accounts for one eight of global timber production (Blaser et al. 2011) and is still increasing. Most tropical timber production originates from selective logging, the targeted harvesting of timber from commercial species in a single cuttint cycle (Martin et al. 2015). On the other hand, tropical rainforests have fascinated ecologists due to their outstanding diversity (Connell 1978). Effectively tropical forests host over half of the Earth’s biodiversity (Scheffers et al. 2012). High biodiversity from tropical rainforests is the source of many ecosystem functions. Amongst others, tropical forests play a key role in biogeochemical cycles, including carbone storage (Lewis et al. 2004). Add insights into carbon storage role of tropical forest. Ecosystem functions from tropical forests support numerous ecosystem services, such as timber production and climate regulation. But several authors argue that selective logging represents a major threat to biodiversity (Carreño-Rocabado et al. 2012; Zimmerman &amp; Kormos 2012; Gibson et al. 2013; Avila et al. 2015; Martin et al. 2015), challenging the sustainable definition from current selective logging. We consequently need to assess both short and long term impacts of selective logging on tropical forest ecosystems to implement better syslvicultural practives in order to reach sustainability. The question of selective logging impact on tropical forest can be directly related to the emerging field of biodiversity and ecosystem functionning (Loreau 2000). Tropical forest outstanding biodiversity will be both a factor and a result of forest ecosystem response to logging disturbance. And forest ecosystem response to logging disturbance will directly modify ecosystem functionning in both short and long term. Consequently assessing selective logging effect on tropical forest linking biodiversity and ecosystem seems an obvious and promising way (Loreau 2010). Paragraph to fully review ! Negative short term impacts of selective logging have been assessed (Carreño-Rocabado et al. 2012; Avila et al. 2015; but see Martin et al. 2015). Much less is known about the long term impact (Osazuwa-Peters et al. 2015). The main reason is the difficulty to conduct long term empirical study (but see Herault et al. 2010), which can be completed by the use of forest simulators (Huth et al. 2004; Köhler &amp; Huth 2004; Tietjen &amp; Huth 2006; Rüger et al. 2008). Individual-based models of forest dynamics present the perfect framework to develop such joint biodiversity-ecosystem approaches (Maréchaux &amp; Chave). Individual-based models describe forest ‘patches’ accumulating carbon through time, assessing tree growth within the patch, or releasing carbon through gap opening (Bugmann 2001). Up to several dozens of different Plant Functional Types (PFTs) are generally defined and models can sometimes be fully spatially explicit (Pacala et al. 1996). Recently, the forest growth simulator TROLL (Chave 1999), an individual-based and spatially explicit forest model, was developped to introduce recent advances in plant physiological community. TROLL model relates physiological processes to species-specific functional traits (Maréchaux &amp; Chave). Consequently, TROLL model allow to simulate fully a neotropical forest biodiversity to study biodiversity-ecosystem functionning link response to logging disturbance. Major question greater diversity (taxonomic and functional) brought a better resilience to disturbance ? References "],

Thus TROLL model, alongside with SORTIE (Pacala et al. 1996; Uriarte et al. 2009) and FORMIND (Köhler &amp; Huth 1998; Fischer et al. 2016), can be defined as an individual-based and spatially explicit forest growth model. TROLL simulates the life cycle of individual trees from recruitment, with a diameter at breast height (dbh) above 1 cm, to death with growth and seed production. Trees are growing in a located light environment explicitly computed witin voxels of 1 \\(m^3\\). Each tree is consistently defined by its age, diameter at brest height (dbh), height (h), crown radius (CR), crown depth (CD) and leaf area (LA) (see figure 1.1). Tree geometry is calculated with allometric equations but leaf area vary dinamically within each crown following carbon allocations. Voxels resolution of 1 \\(m^3\\) allow the establishment of maximum one tree by 1x1 m pixels. Each tree is flagged with a species label inherited from the parent tree through the seedling recruitment. A species label is associated to a number of species specific parameters (see table 1.1) related to functional trait values which can be sampled on the field. Table 1.1: Species-specific parameters used in TROLL from Maréchaux &amp; Chave. Data originates from the BRIDGE (Baraloto et al. 2010) and TRY (Kattge et al. 2011) datasets. Abbreviation Description Units \\(LMA\\) leaf mass per area \\(g.m^-2\\) \\(N_m\\) leaf nitrogen content per dry mass \\(mg.g^-1\\) \\(P_m\\) leaf phosphorous content per dry mass \\(mg.g^-1\\) \\(wsg\\) wood specific gravity \\(g.cm^-3\\) \\(dbh_{thresh}\\) diameter at breasth height threshold \\(m\\) \\(h_{lim}\\) asymptotic height \\(m\\) \\(a_h\\) parameter of the tree-height-dbh allometry \\(m\\) Carbon assimilation is computed over half-hourly period of a representative day. Then allocation is computed to simulate tree growth from an explicit carbone balance (in contrast to previous models). Finally environment is updated at each timestep set to one month. Seedlings are not simulated explicitly but as a pool. In addition belowground processes, herbaceous plants, epiphytes and lianas are not simulated inside TROLL. The source code is written in C++ and available upon request. All analyses were conducted in R version 3.4.0 Cite R, add entry in Mendeley. Figure 1.1: Individuals tree inside TROLL explicit spatial grid from Maréchaux &amp; Chave. Tree geometry (crown radius CR, crown depth CD, height h, diameter at breast height dbh) is updated at each timestep following allometric relationship with assimilated carbon allocated to growth. Each tree is flagged with a species label linking to its species-specific attributes. Light is compputed explicitly at each timestep for each voxel. 1.2 Abiotic environment A voxel space, with a resolution of 1 \\(m^3\\), is used to explicilty model the abiotic environment. For each tree crown, leaf area density is calculated on tree geometry assuming a uniform distriution across voxels occupied by the crown. Leaf area density is computed within each voxel summing all tree crowns inside the voxel \\(v\\), and is denoted \\(LAD(v)\\) (leaf area per voxel in \\(m².m^-3\\)). The vertical sum of \\(LAD\\) from voxel \\(v\\) to the ground level defines \\(LAI(v)\\) (leaf area per fround area in \\(m^2.m^-2\\) commonly called leaf area index): \\[\\begin{equation} LAI(v) = \\sum _{v&#39;=v} ^\\infty LAD(v&#39;) \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] Daily variations in light intensity (photosynthetic photon flux density PPFD in \\(\\mu mol_{photons}.m^-2.s^-1\\)), temperature (T in degrees Celsius), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD in \\(kPA\\)) are computed to assess carbon assimilation within each voxel of the canopy and for a representative day per month (see Appendix 1 from Maréchaux &amp; Chave for further details). Variation of PPFD Within the canopy is calculated as a loacal Beer-Lambert extinction law: \\[\\begin{equation} PPFD_{max,month}(v) = PPFD_{top,max,month}*e^{-k*LAI(v)} \\tag{1.2} \\end{equation}\\] The daily maximum incident PPFD at the top of canopy \\(PPFD_{top,max,month}\\) is given as input. The extinction rate \\(k\\) is assumed as constant (see table ?? for parameters value), besides is variation with zenith angle and species leaf inclination angle (Meir et al. 2000). Moreover only vertical light diffusion is considered ignoring lateral light diffusion, which can have an important role especially in logging gaps. Finally, intra-day variation at half hour time steps \\(t\\) for a representative day every month are used to compute \\(PPFD_{month}(v,t)\\), \\(T_{month}(v,t)\\) and \\(VPD_{month}(v,t)\\). Water and nutrient process both in soil and inside trees are not simulated. 1.3 Photosynthesis 1.4 Autotrophic respiration 1.5 Carbon uptake 1.6 Tree growth 1.7 Recruitment 1.8 Mortality References "],
