["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Sutainable forest management in the tropics (i.e. managed selective harvesting of timber) has been widely promoted internationnaly to combat tropical deforestation and degradation (Zimmerman &amp; Kormos 2012). Currently tropical logging accounts for one eight of global timber production (Blaser et al. 2011) and is still increasing. Most tropical timber production originates from selective logging, the targeted harvesting of timber from commercial species in a single cuttint cycle (Martin et al. 2015). On the other hand, tropical rainforests have fascinated ecologists due to their outstanding diversity (Connell 1978). Effectively tropical forests host over half of the Earth’s biodiversity (Scheffers et al. 2012). High biodiversity from tropical rainforests is the source of many ecosystem functions. Amongst others, tropical forests play a key role in biogeochemical cycles, including carbone storage (Lewis et al. 2004). Add insights into carbon storage role of tropical forest. Ecosystem functions from tropical forests support numerous ecosystem services, such as timber production and climate regulation. But several authors argue that selective logging represents a major threat to biodiversity (Carreño-Rocabado et al. 2012; Zimmerman &amp; Kormos 2012; Gibson et al. 2013; Avila et al. 2015; Martin et al. 2015), challenging the sustainable definition from current selective logging. We consequently need to assess both short and long term impacts of selective logging on tropical forest ecosystems to implement better syslvicultural practives in order to reach sustainability. The question of selective logging impact on tropical forest can be directly related to the emerging field of biodiversity and ecosystem functionning (Loreau 2000). Tropical forest outstanding biodiversity will be both a factor and a result of forest ecosystem response to logging disturbance. And forest ecosystem response to logging disturbance will directly modify ecosystem functionning in both short and long term. Consequently assessing selective logging effect on tropical forest linking biodiversity and ecosystem seems an obvious and promising way (Loreau 2010). Paragraph to fully review ! Negative short term impacts of selective logging have been assessed (Carreño-Rocabado et al. 2012; Avila et al. 2015; but see Martin et al. 2015). Much less is known about the long term impact (Osazuwa-Peters et al. 2015). The main reason is the difficulty to conduct long term empirical study (but see Herault et al. 2010), which can be completed by the use of forest simulators (Huth et al. 2004; K�hler &amp; Huth 2004; Tietjen &amp; Huth 2006; Rüger et al. 2008). Individual-based models of forest dynamics present the perfect framework to develop such joint biodiversity-ecosystem approaches (Maréchaux &amp; Chave). Individual-based models describe forest ‘patches’ accumulating carbon through time, assessing tree growth within the patch, or releasing carbon through gap opening (Bugmann 2001). Up to several dozens of different Plant Functional Types (PFTs) are generally defined and models can sometimes be fully spatially explicit Cite Pacala et al. 1996. Recently, the forest growth simulator TROLL (Chave 1999), an individual-based and spatially explicit forest model, was developped to introduce recent advances in plant physiological community. TROLL model relates physiological processes to species-specific functional traits (Maréchaux &amp; Chave). Consequently, TROLL model allow to simulate fully a neotropical forest biodiversity to study biodiversity-ecosystem functionning link response to logging disturbance. Major question greater diversity (taxonomic and functional) brought a better resilience to disturbance ? References "],
