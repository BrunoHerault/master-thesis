["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Sutainable forest management in the tropics (i.e. managed selective harvesting of timber) has been widely promoted internationnaly to combat tropical deforestation and degradation (Zimmerman &amp; Kormos 2012). Currently tropical logging accounts for one eight of global timber production (Blaser et al. 2011) and is still increasing. Most tropical timber production originates from selective logging, the targeted harvesting of timber from commercial species in a single cuttint cycle (Martin et al. 2015). On the other hand, tropical rainforests have fascinated ecologists due to their outstanding diversity (Connell 1978). Effectively tropical forests host over half of the Earth’s biodiversity (Scheffers et al. 2012). High biodiversity from tropical rainforests is the source of many ecosystem functions. Amongst others, tropical forests play a key role in biogeochemical cycles, including carbone storage (Lewis et al. 2004). Add insights into carbon storage role of tropical forest. Ecosystem functions from tropical forests support numerous ecosystem services, such as timber production and climate regulation. But several authors argue that selective logging represents a major threat to biodiversity (Carreño-Rocabado et al. 2012; Zimmerman &amp; Kormos 2012; Gibson et al. 2013; Avila et al. 2015; Martin et al. 2015), challenging the sustainable definition from current selective logging. We consequently need to assess both short and long term impacts of selective logging on tropical forest ecosystems to implement better syslvicultural practives in order to reach sustainability. The question of selective logging impact on tropical forest can be directly related to the emerging field of biodiversity and ecosystem functionning (Loreau 2000). Tropical forest outstanding biodiversity will be both a factor and a result of forest ecosystem response to logging disturbance. And forest ecosystem response to logging disturbance will directly modify ecosystem functionning in both short and long term. Consequently assessing selective logging effect on tropical forest linking biodiversity and ecosystem seems an obvious and promising way (Loreau 2010). Paragraph to fully review ! Negative short term impacts of selective logging have been assessed (Carreño-Rocabado et al. 2012; Avila et al. 2015; but see Martin et al. 2015). Much less is known about the long term impact (Osazuwa-Peters et al. 2015). The main reason is the difficulty to conduct long term empirical study (but see Herault et al. 2010), which can be completed by the use of forest simulators (Huth et al. 2004; Köhler &amp; Huth 2004; Tietjen &amp; Huth 2006; Rüger et al. 2008). Individual-based models of forest dynamics present the perfect framework to develop such joint biodiversity-ecosystem approaches (Maréchaux &amp; Chave). Individual-based models describe forest ‘patches’ accumulating carbon through time, assessing tree growth within the patch, or releasing carbon through gap opening (Bugmann 2001). Up to several dozens of different Plant Functional Types (PFTs) are generally defined and models can sometimes be fully spatially explicit (Pacala et al. 1996). Recently, the forest growth simulator TROLL (Chave 1999), an individual-based and spatially explicit forest model, was developped to introduce recent advances in plant physiological community. TROLL model relates physiological processes to species-specific functional traits (Maréchaux &amp; Chave). Consequently, TROLL model allow to simulate fully a neotropical forest biodiversity to study biodiversity-ecosystem functionning link response to logging disturbance. Major question greater diversity (taxonomic and functional) brought a better resilience to disturbance ? References "],
["model-description.html", "1 Model description 1.1 Overview 1.2 Leaf lifespan 1.3 Disturbance 1.4 Sylviculture", " 1 Model description 1.1 Overview TROLL model each tree indivdually in a located environment. Thus TROLL model, alongside with SORTIE (Pacala et al. 1996; Uriarte et al. 2009) and FORMIND (Köhler &amp; Huth 1998; Fischer et al. 2016), can be defined as an individual-based and spatially explicit forest growth model. TROLL simulates the life cycle of individual trees from recruitment, with a diameter at breast height (dbh) above 1 cm, to death with growth and seed production. Trees are growing in a located light environment explicitly computed witin voxels of 1 \\(m^3\\). Each tree is consistently defined by its age, diameter at brest height (dbh), height (h), crown radius (CR), crown depth (CD) and leaf area (LA) (see figure 1.1). Tree geometry is calculated with allometric equations but leaf area vary dinamically within each crown following carbon allocations. Voxels resolution of 1 \\(m^3\\) allow the establishment of maximum one tree by 1x1 m pixels. Each tree is flagged with a species label inherited from the parent tree through the seedling recruitment. A species label is associated to a number of species specific parameters (see table 1.1) related to functional trait values which can be sampled on the field. Figure 1.1: Individuals tree inside TROLL explicit spatial grid from Maréchaux &amp; Chave. Tree geometry (crown radius CR, crown depth CD, height h, diameter at breast height dbh) is updated at each timestep following allometric relationship with assimilated carbon allocated to growth. Each tree is flagged with a species label linking to its species-specific attributes. Light is compputed explicitly at each timestep for each voxel. Carbon assimilation is computed over half-hourly period of a representative day. Then allocation is computed to simulate tree growth from an explicit carbone balance (in contrast to previous models). Finally environment is updated at each timestep set to one month. Seedlings are not simulated explicitly but as a pool. In addition belowground processes, herbaceous plants, epiphytes and lianas are not simulated inside TROLL. The source code is written in C++ and available upon request. All modules of TROLL models are further detailed in Appendix 1: TROLL model. Table 1.1: Species-specific parameters used in TROLL from Maréchaux &amp; Chave. Data originates from the BRIDGE (Baraloto et al. 2010) and TRY (Kattge et al. 2011) datasets. Abbreviation Description Units \\(LMA\\) leaf mass per area \\(g.m^{-2}\\) \\(N_m\\) leaf nitrogen content per dry mass \\(mg.g^{-1}\\) \\(P_m\\) leaf phosphorous content per dry mass \\(mg.g^{-1}\\) \\(wsg\\) wood specific gravity \\(g.cm^{-3}\\) \\(dbh_{thresh}\\) diameter at breasth height threshold \\(m\\) \\(h_{lim}\\) asymptotic height \\(m\\) \\(a_h\\) parameter of the tree-height-dbh allometry \\(m\\) Previous implementation of TROLL model used Reich et al. (1991) allometry to infer leaf lifespan \\(LL\\) from species leaf mass per area \\(LMA\\) (Maréchaux &amp; Chave, see Appendix 1: TROLL model). But the use of the allometrie from Reich et al. (1991) with current implementation of the TROLL model resulted in an underestimation of leaf lifespan for low LMA species. Consequently in the following paragraph we suggest a new allometry. Selective logging is defined as the targeted harvesting of timber from species of interest. Consequently, tropical sylviculture can be assimilated to a disturbance. The main difference between a disturbance and selective logging is the targetting of both species and individuals of interest. So we decided to first asses unselective disturbance effect on tropical forest ecosystem to subsequently better understand selective logging effect. First, we implemented a disturbance module inside TROLL model to simulate unselective disturbance. Secondly, we implemented a sylviculture module inside TROLL model to simulate selective logging in regards to french Guiana practices. 1.2 Leaf lifespan The underestimation of leaf lifespan for low LMA species with the allometry from Reich et al. (1991) resulted in indivduals unealistic early death from carbon starvation. We gathered data from TRY(Kattge et al. 2011), DRYAD (Chave et al. 2009) and GLOPNET (Wright et al. 2004) datasets. We used an out of the bag method applied on a random forest to select variables with highest importance to explain leaf lifespan. We thus selected leaf mass per are \\(LMA\\), leaf nitrogen content \\(N\\) and wood specific gravity \\(wsg\\). We then used a bayesian approach to test different models with growing level of complexity. The model with the best tradeoff between complexity (number of parameters), convergence, likelihood, and prediction quality (root mean square error of prediction RMSEP) was kept. We selected following model with a maximum likelihood of 13.6 and a RMSEP of 12 months: \\[\\begin{equation} LL_{d} \\sim log\\mathcal{N}({\\beta_1}_d*LMA - {\\beta_2}_d*N*\\beta_3*wsg, \\sigma) \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] Leaf lifespan \\(LL\\) follows a lognormal law with location infered from leaf lifespan \\(LMA\\), nitrogen content \\(N\\) and wood specific gravity \\(wsg\\) and a scale \\(\\sigma\\). Each \\({\\beta_i}_d\\) is following a normal law located on \\(\\beta_i\\) with a scale of \\(\\sigma_i\\). All \\(\\beta_i\\), \\(\\sigma_i\\), and \\(\\sigma\\) are assumed without presemption following a gamma law. \\(d\\) represents the dataset random effects and encompass environmental and protocol variations (see Appendix 2: Leaf lifespan model for more details). 1.3 Disturbance Disturbance module was designed in the simplest way in order to relate the ecosystem answer to volume lost without any individuals nor species targetting. For a given iteration \\(disturb_{iter}\\), individuals are picked randomly with a uniform law on the number of trees. Selected individuals are then removed without trigerring a treefall to avoid any side effect. The operation is repeated untill the disturbance result in a defined lost basal area (\\(disturb_{intensity}\\) in % of BA). 1.4 Sylviculture In french guiana context sylviculture can be narrow to selective logging, which can be split in two steps: selection and harvesting. Selection encompass choice of the havrestable area, tree designation by the forest office, tree selection by the harvester, and removal off tree probbed as rotten by the lumber. Harvesting encompass tree felling, tracks opening, and long term damages (simplified in gap damages in current TROLL implementation). 1.4.1 Designation and selection One major limit of current implementation of TROLL model is that it assumes a flat environment. Consequently the whole simulated area inside TROLL is considered has an harvestable zone. With all commercial species minimum and maximum harvestable diameter, TROLL calculates the total harvestable volume \\({V_h}_{tot}\\). If the total harvestable volume \\({V_h}_{tot}\\) exceed \\(30~m^3.hectare^{-1}\\), commercial species minimum harvestable diameter \\(dbh_{min}\\) is increased untill \\({V_h}_{tot}\\) is inferior to that upper limit. In french guiana, tree harvesters are focusing on few species with easier marketable wood, resulting in a tree harvest around \\(20~m^3.ha^{-1}\\) (Laurent Descroix, ONF, personnal communication). TROLL ranks each commercial species on its economic value, and randomly remove individuals from lowest rank species untill it reaches total harvested volume \\({V_{hd}}_{tot}\\) (\\({V_{hd}}_{tot}\\) was set to \\(25~m^3.hectare^{-1}\\) in subsequent simulations). 1.4.2 Rotten trees 20 to 30 % of designated trees are considered as rotten once probed by the lumberman, and thus not harvested. Rotten trees are not random and depends both on tree species and diameter. We gathered data from the forest office (ONF, Laurent Descroix, personnal communication) inventories precising if tree were probbed as rotten and their corresponding species and diameter. In addition, tree plots and sawed volume was informed. We then used a bayesian approach to model the link between tree species and diameter and their risk to be probbed as rotten by the lumberman. We test different models with growing level of complexity and kept the model with the best tradeoff between complexity (number of parameters), convergence, likelihood, and prediction quality (root mean square error of prediction RMSEP): \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{c} probbed~rotten \\sim \\mathcal{B}(P(probbed~rotten)) \\\\ P(probbed~rotten) = logit^{-1}(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*dbh) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*dbh}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1*dbh}} \\end{array} \\tag{1.2} \\end{equation}\\] Tree \\(probbed~rotten\\) follows a \\(Bernoulli\\) law of probability \\(P(probbed~rotten)\\). The odds for a tree to be probbed as rotten are calculated with the sum of a base odd to be rotten \\(\\beta_0\\) and a diameter dependent odd calculated with \\(\\beta_1\\). The probability for a tree to be probbed as rotten \\(P(probbed~rotten)\\) is finally calculated by taking the inverse logit \\(logit^{-1}\\) of the odd (see Appendix 3: Rotten tree model for more details). 1.4.3 Harvesting Due to crown aspects, treefall from logs are often random (whereas difficult to manage, treefall can still be oriented, Laurent Descroix, ONF, personnal communication). Consequently, TROLL consider treefall from log as random like current natural treefall implementation inside TROLL (see code [Appendix 1]). Tree harvesting roads are split in three classes: truck roads, main tractor track, and secondary track. Because TROLL assumes a flat environment, the main track is opened starting from the middle of one side of the simulated forest and untill it reaches the center with a width of 6 meters. In most cases, secondary tracks are opened once trees have been designated and the geolocation taken at a maximum distance of 30 meters from designated trees (Laurent Descroix, ONF, personnal communication). To simulate secondary tracks, TROLL uses a loads map, measuring every trees at a distance of 30 meters for each pixel, and a track proximity maps of the closest existing track. Next, the model select the pixel with the highest load and closest track, find the closest existing track and join it by removing tree in the way with a width of 5 meters. The operations are repeated untill no felt trees are left. 1.4.4 Gap damages Most of models account long term damages due to selective logging with a 10 years increased mortality (Huth et al. 2004; Köhler &amp; Huth 2004; Rüger et al. 2008). We decided to model explicitly long term logging damages because of their localised nature through a gap damages model. We gathered data from Paracou dataset (Guehl et al. 2004) in cenususes between 1988 and 1992 on Paracou harvested plots. Individuals were categorized between alive, dead, or recruited during the period. We measured each individual distance to the closest gap. We then used a bayesian approach to test the link between tree death in the four years following the log event and distance to the closest gap. We adapted the model from Herault et al. (2010) based on a disturbance index into: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{c} Death \\sim \\mathcal{B}(P(Death)) \\\\ P(Death) = logit^{-1}(\\theta + \\beta*e^{\\alpha*d_{gaps}}) = \\frac{e^{\\theta + \\beta*e^{\\alpha*d_{gaps}}}}{1 + e^{\\theta + \\beta*e^{\\alpha*d_{gaps}}}} \\end{array} \\tag{1.3} \\end{equation}\\] \\(Death\\) of a tree follows a \\(\\mathcal{Bernoulli}\\) law of probability \\(P(Death)\\). The odds for a tree to die are calculated with the sum of the natural tree death odd \\(\\theta\\) and a perturbation index \\(\\beta*e^{\\alpha*d_{gaps}}\\). The perturbation index depend on the distance \\(d_{gaps}\\) of the tree \\(i\\) to the closest logging gap. The probability for a tree to die \\(P(Death)\\) is finally calculated by taking the inverse logit \\(logit^{-1}\\) of the odd. References "],
["material-and-methods.html", "2 Material and Methods 2.1 Sensitivity analysis 2.2 Design of experiment 2.3 Ecosystem answer analysis", " 2 Material and Methods 2.1 Sensitivity analysis Maréchaux &amp; Chave already assessed TROLL model sensitivity to several parameters (\\(k\\) see (A.2), \\(\\phi\\) see (A.25), \\(g1\\) see (A.6), \\(f_{wood}\\) see (A.14), \\(f_{canopy}\\) see (A.16) and \\(m\\) see (A.21)) which they assumed having a key role in model functioning. On the other hand, we decided to use TROLL to study resistance and resilience of ecosystem face to disturbance, highlighting the role of biodiversity. Consequently we particulrarly needed to assess the importance of functional traits to further better control and evaluate functional diversities. We also needed to assess the sensitivity of TROLL model to the seed rain constant (\\(n_{ext}\\), see (A.24)) because we assumed it as one of the main factors of tree recruitments after disturbance within simulations. TROLL model currenty uses leaf mass per area (\\(LMA\\) in \\(g.m^{-2}\\)), leaf nitrogen content per dry mass (\\(N_m\\) in \\(mg.g^{-1}\\)), leaf phosphorus content per dry mass (\\(P_m\\) in \\(mg.g^{-1}\\)), wood specific gravity (\\(wsg\\) in \\(g.cm^{-3}\\)), diameter at breasth height threshold (\\(dbh_{thresh}\\) in \\(m\\)), asymptotic height (\\(h_{lim}\\) in \\(m\\)), and parameter of the tree-height-dbh allometry (\\(a_h\\) in \\(m\\)). To assess the sensitivity of TROLL model to species functionnal traits, we performed a sensitivity analysis by fixing species trait values to their mean. Each trait was tested independently. We reduce to a common mean traits with a Pearson’s correlation value \\(r \\geq 0.8\\) (\\(h_{max}\\) and \\(a_h\\) with a correlation of \\(r=0.98\\)). To assess the sensitivity of TROLL model to seed rain, we performed a sensitivity analysis by fixing simulations seed rain constant to 2, 20, 200 and 2000 seeds per hectare. Simulations were conducted on Intel Xeon(R) with 32 CPUs of 2.00GHz and 188.9 GB of memory. We assumed maturity of the forest after 500 years of regeneration (Maréchaux &amp; Chave) and computed simulation 100 years after a disturbance event with 40% loss of basal area. Due to computer limitations we did not run replicate (besides it should be necessary to reduce simulation stochasticity). To assess ecosystem outputs sensitivity to studied parameters, we compared it to 100 replicates of control simulations with all parameters set to default values. Ecosystem outputs outside of the range of the control replicates values are significantly influenced by the studied parameter. 2.2 Design of experiment In order to assess the role of biodiversity in ecosystem answer to both disturbance and sylviculture, we needed to create a space of experiments encompassing both variation of disturbance, biodiversity and time. Disturbance was represented by percentage of basal area loss (0%, 25%, 50% and 75%), or as a selective logging simulation. Biodiversity was integrated with two components of its components: taxonomic and functional diversities. We used species richness \\(SR\\) to represents taxonomic diversity (5, 25, and 125 species). Functional diversity can be related to numerous components, and Perrone et al. (2017) argued for 5: richness, divergence, regularity, overlap and mean. Because mature forest were created from a bare soil with TROLL simulations, we could not control a priori divergence, regularity and overlap but only assess theim before diturbance. Consequently, we focused on functional richness with convex hull volume \\(CHV\\) and functional mean with community weighted mean \\(CWM\\). For each level of species richness \\(SR\\), we selected 20 communities with growing convex hull volume \\(CHV\\) but with a community weighted means close to the regional species pool community weighted means. Effectivelly, we did not wanted drastic change in community means that could have more effect than functional richness itself. This design of experiments resulted in 60 communities (\\(5~SR*20~CHV\\)) and 240 simulations (\\(60 ~communities*4~levels~of~disturbance\\)) over 600 years (maturity being assumed after 500 years of regeneration (Maréchaux &amp; Chave)). Figure 2.1 presents the design of experiment for communities biodiversity after the mature forest were simulated, and thus before disturbance. We obtained a broad range of both functionl dispersion \\(FDis\\) and aboveground biomass \\(AGB\\) for simulated forest ecosystems before disturbance. Figure 2.1: Experimental design before disturbance. Communities are implemented along a gradient of species richness (SR) and functional dispersion (FDis) resulting in a broad range of aboveground biomass (AGB). FDis was caluclated based on 4 functional traits (leaf mass per area, wood specific gravity, maximum diameter, and maximum height). 2.3 Ecosystem answer analysis 2.3.1 Resilience Tropical forest ecosystems provides numerous ecosystem services linked to several ecosystem functions. We decided to describe simiulated tropical forests in three major functions: forest dynamic, forest production, and forest diversity. Forest dynamic was represented by aboveground biomass (\\(AGB\\) in \\(ton~C.ha^{-1}\\)), basal area (\\(BA\\) in \\(m^2.ha^{-1}\\)), total number of stem (\\(N\\)), number of stem above \\(10~cm\\) diameter (\\(N10\\)), and number of stem above \\(30~cm\\) diameter (\\(N30\\)). Forest production was represented by growth pimary productivity (\\(GPP\\) in \\(MgC.ha^{-1}\\)), net pimary productivity (\\(NPP\\) in \\(MgC.ha^{-1}\\)), tree autotrophic respiration in day (\\(Rday\\) in \\(MgC.ha^{-1}\\)) and tree autotrophic respiration in night (\\(Rnight\\) in \\(MgC.ha^{-1}\\)). Finally, forest diversity was represented by ??. The resilience of metrics values post disturbance were assessed through Henry &amp; Emmanuel Ramirez-Marquez (2012) formula: \\[\\begin{equation} R\\left(t\\right)=\\frac{Recovery\\left(t\\right)}{Loss\\left(t_d\\right)} \\approx \\frac{X_T(t)}{X_C(t)} \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] The resilience of the system \\(R(t)\\) at the time \\(t\\) is described by the ratio of recovery \\(Recovery(t)\\) at time \\(t\\) to loss suffered \\(Loss(t_d)\\) at disturbance time \\(t_d\\). But in our peculiar case of tropical forest ecosystems, the equilibrium used to calculate \\(Loss(t_d)\\) can not be reduced to a specific time if the equilibrium is dynamic. Consequently, to encompass undisturbed ecosystem variations throught time, we simulated an undisturbed control ecosystem \\(C\\). And the resilience of the system \\(R(t)\\) at the time \\(t\\) was defined as the ratio of the ecosystem metric values in the disturbed simulation \\(X_T(t)\\) over the the ecosystem metric values from the control \\(X_C(t)\\) . Thus, the value of resilience \\(R(t)\\) is normalized for all simulations and metrics. \\(R(t)\\) will be equal to \\(R_{eq} = 1\\) when reaching the equilibrium value. Consequently we can calculate an euclidean distance to equilibrium \\(d_{eq}(t)\\) as \\(d_{eq}(t) = \\sqrt{(R_{eq} - R(t))^2}\\). 2.3.2 Biodiversity effect Biodiversity is not only a facet of the experimental design and an ecosystem output through forest diversity, but also interact on ecosystem functioning and consequently on its answer to disturbance. Biodiversity ecosystem functioning relation can be split in complementarity and selection effect with Loreau &amp; Hector (2001) partitioning: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{c} NE = X_O - X_E = CE + SE \\\\ CE = N* \\overline{\\Delta RX} \\overline{M}\\\\ SE = N*cov(\\Delta RX,M) \\end{array} \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] Biodiversity net effect \\(NE\\) is based on the difference between ecosystem variable \\(X\\) observed value \\(X_O\\) within the community mixture of species and its expected value \\(X_E\\) if species performance were equal to their performance in monocultures. This effect can be partitioned between complementarity effect \\(CE\\), representing niche partitionning, positive interactions, and resource supply, and selectvie effect \\(SE\\) due to dominant species pool driving the ecosystem. Both metrics depend on the variation of relative ecosystem variable \\(\\Delta RX\\): \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta RX_{sp} = \\frac{X_{sp}(mixture)}{X_{sp}(monoculture)} - P_{sp} \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] \\(X_sp\\) is the ecosystem variable value for one species either in mixture \\(X_{sp}(mixture)\\) or in monoculture \\(X_{sp}(monoculture)\\). \\(P_{sp}\\) is the proportion of the species in the mixture represented by species relative abundance. Consequently, \\(CE\\) averages diversity effects of all species presents in the mixture (both negatives and positives). Whereas \\(SE\\) become positive when dominant species outperform theimselves in mixture than in monoculture, and negative when less dominant species outperform theimselves in mixture than in monoculture (Tobner et al. 2016). Recovery trajectories of ecosystem variable after disturbance were partitioned between complementarity effect \\(CE\\) and selection effect \\(SE\\). In order to do that, the design of experiment was repeated for each species indivdually representing 652 simulations of monoculture. References "],

A.1 Abiotic environment A voxel space, with a resolution of 1 \\(m^3\\), is used to explicilty model the abiotic environment. For each tree crown, leaf area density is calculated on tree geometry assuming a uniform distriution across voxels occupied by the crown. Leaf area density is computed within each voxel summing all tree crowns inside the voxel \\(v\\), and is denoted \\(LAD(v)\\) (leaf area per voxel in \\(m².m^{-3}\\)). The vertical sum of \\(LAD\\) from voxel \\(v\\) to the ground level defines \\(LAI(v)\\) (leaf area per fround area in \\(m^2.m^{-2}\\) commonly called leaf area index): \\[\\begin{equation} LAI(v) = \\sum _{v&#39;=v} ^\\infty LAD(v&#39;) \\tag{A.1} \\end{equation}\\] Daily variations in light intensity (photosynthetic photon flux density PPFD in \\(\\mu mol_{photons}.m^{-2}.s^{-1}\\)), temperature (T in degrees Celsius), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD in \\(kPA\\)) are computed to assess carbon assimilation within each voxel of the canopy and for a representative day per month (see Appendix 1 from Maréchaux &amp; Chave for further details). Variation of PPFD Within the canopy is calculated as a loacal Beer-Lambert extinction law: \\[\\begin{equation} PPFD_{max,month}(v) = PPFD_{top,max,month}*e^{-k*LAI(v)} \\tag{A.2} \\end{equation}\\] The daily maximum incident PPFD at the top of canopy \\(PPFD_{top,max,month}\\) is given as input. The extinction rate \\(k\\) is assumed as constant, besides is variation with zenith angle and species leaf inclination angle (Meir et al. 2000). Moreover only vertical light diffusion is considered ignoring lateral light diffusion, which can have an important role especially in logging gaps. Finally, intra-day variation at half hour time steps \\(t\\) for a representative day every month are used to compute \\(PPFD_{month}(v,t)\\), \\(T_{month}(v,t)\\) and \\(VPD_{month}(v,t)\\). Water and nutrient process both in soil and inside trees are not simulated. A.2 Photosynthesis A.2.1 Theory Troll simulates the carbon uptake of each individual with the Farquhar, von Caemmerer and Berry model of C3 photosynthesis (Farquhar et al. 1980). Gross carbon assimilation rate (\\(A\\) in \\(\\mu mol~CO_2. m^{-2}.s^{-1}\\)) will be the minimum of eiter Rubisco activity (\\(A_v\\)) or RuBP generation (\\(A_j\\)): \\[\\begin{equation} A=min(A_v, A_j)~|~A_v=V_{cmax}*\\frac{c_i-\\Gamma^*}{c_i+K_m}~;~A_j=\\frac{J}{4}*\\frac{c_i-\\Gamma^*}{c_i+2*\\Gamma^*} \\tag{A.3} \\end{equation}\\] \\(V_{cmax}\\) is the maximum rate of carboxylation (\\(\\mu mol~CO_2.m^{-2}.s^{-1}\\)). \\(c_i\\) is the \\(CO_2\\) partial pressure at carboxylation sites. \\(\\Gamma^*\\) is the \\(CO_2\\) compensation point in absence of dark respiration. \\(K_m\\) is the apparent knietic constant of the Rubisco. And \\(J\\) is the electron transport rate (\\(\\mu mol e^-.m^{-2}.s^{-1}\\)). \\(J\\) depends on the light intensity with \\(PPFD\\): \\[\\begin{equation} J = \\frac{1}{2*\\theta}*[\\alpha*PPFD+J_{max}-\\sqrt{(\\alpha*PPFD+J_{max})^2}-4*\\theta*\\alpha*PPFD*J_{max}] \\tag{A.4} \\end{equation}\\] \\(J_{max}\\) is the maximal electron transport capacity (\\(\\mu mol e^-.m^{-2}.s^{-1}\\)). \\(\\theta\\) is the curvature factor. And \\(\\alpha\\) is the apparent quantum yield to electron transport (\\(mole^-.mol~photons^{-1}\\)). Carbon assimilation by photosynthesis will then be limited by the \\(CO_2\\) partial pressure at carboxylation sites. Stomata controls the gas concentration at carboxylation sites throught stomatal transport: \\[\\begin{equation} A = g_s*(c_a-c_i) \\tag{A.5} \\end{equation}\\] \\(g_s\\) is the stomatal conductance to \\(CO_2\\) (\\(molCO_2.m^{-2}.s^{-1}\\)). TROLL simulates stomatal conductance \\(g_s\\) with the model from (Medlyn et al. 2011): \\[\\begin{equation} g_s = g_0 + (1 + \\frac{g_1}{\\sqrt{VPD}})*\\frac{A}{c_a} \\tag{A.6} \\end{equation}\\] \\(g_0\\) and \\(g_1\\) are parameters from the model. TROLL model assume \\(g_0 \\approx 0\\) (empirically tested and considered as reasonable). A.2.2 Parametrization Leaf traits can be used as proxy of photosynthesis, especially leaf nutrient content which directly play a role in it (Wright et al. 2004). Domingues et al. (2010) suggested that \\(V_{cmac}\\) and \\(J_{max}\\) were both limited by the leaf concentration of nitrogen \\(N\\) and phosphorus \\(P\\) (\\(mg.g^{-1}\\)): \\[\\begin{equation} log_{10} V_{cmax-M} = min( \\begin{array}{c} -1.56+0.43*log_{10} N-0.37*log_{10} LMA \\\\ -0.80+0.45*log_{10} P-0.25*log_{10} LMA \\end{array} ) \\tag{A.7} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} log_{10} J_{max-M} = min( \\begin{array}{c} -1.50+0.41*log_{10} N-0.45*log_{10} LMA \\\\ -0.74+0.44*log_{10} P-0.32*log_{10} LMA \\end{array} ) \\tag{A.8} \\end{equation}\\] \\(V_{cmax-M}\\) and \\(J_{max-M}\\) are the photosynthetic capacities at \\(25^\\circ C\\) of mature leaves per leaf dry mass (resp. \\(\\mu mol CO_2.g^-1.s^{-1}\\) and \\(\\mu mol e^-.g^{-1}.s^{-1}\\)). \\(LMA\\) is the leaf mass per are (\\(g.cm^{-2}\\)). \\(V_{cmax}\\) and \\(J_{max}\\) are calculated by multiplying \\(V_{cmax-M}\\) and \\(J_{max-M}\\) by \\(LMA\\). \\(V_{cmax}\\) and \\(J_{max}\\) variation with temperature are caluclated with Bernacchi et al. (2003) (see Appendix 2 from Maréchaux &amp; Chave for further details). TROLL computes leaf carbon assimilation \\(A_l\\) combining equations from (A.3) to (A.8) for each tree crown voxel within in each crown layer \\(l\\): \\[\\begin{equation} A_l = \\frac{1}{n_v*t_M} * \\sum_v \\sum^{t_M}_{t=1} A(PPFD_{month}(v,t),VPD_{month}(v,t),T_{month}(v,t)) \\tag{A.9} \\end{equation}\\] \\(PPFD_{month}(v,t)\\), \\(VPD_{month}(v,t)\\) , and \\(T_{month}(v,t)\\) are derived from microclimatic data. \\(n_v\\) is the number of voxels within crown layer \\(l\\). And the sum is calculated over the \\(t_M\\) half-hourly intervals \\(t\\) of a tipical day. A.3 Autotrophic respiration A large fraction of plants carbon uptake is actually used for plant maintenance and growth respiration. The autotrophic respiration can represents up to 65% of the gross primary productivity but varies strongly among species, sites, and environnements. TROLL uses Atkin et al. (2015) database of mature leaf dark respiration and associated leaf traits to compute leaf maintenance respiration: \\[\\begin{equation} R_{leaf-M} = 8.5431-0.1306*N-0.5670*P-0.0137*LMA+11.1*V_{cmax-M}+0.1876*N*P \\tag{A.10} \\end{equation}\\] \\(R_{leaf-M}\\) si the dark respiration rate per leaf dry mass at a temperaure of \\(25^\\circ C\\) (\\(nmolCO_2.g^{-1}.s^{-1}\\)). The other terms are in equations (A.7) and (A.8). TROLL assume leaf respiration during day light to be 40% of leaf dark respiration, and computes total leaf respiration by accounting for the legnth of daylight. TROLL model stem respiration (\\(R_{stem}\\) in \\(\\mu molC.s^{-1}\\)) with a constant respiration rate per volume of sapwood: \\[\\begin{equation} R_{stem} = 39.6*\\pi*ST*(dbh-ST)*(h-CD) \\tag{A.11} \\end{equation}\\] dbh, h, CD and ST are tree diameter at breast height, height, corwn depth and sapwoond thickness, respectively (\\(m\\)). TROLL assumes \\(ST=0.04~m\\) when \\(dbh&gt;30~cm\\) and an increasing \\(ST\\) for lower \\(dbh\\). Finally, TROLL computes both fine root maintenance respiration, as half of the leaf maintenance respiration. Whereas coarse root and branch maintenance respiration is computed as half of the stem respiration. And growth respiration (\\(R_{growth}\\)) is assumed to account for 25% of the gross primary productivity minus the sum of maintenance respirations. A.4 Net carbon uptake Net primary production of carbon for one individual \\(NPP_{ind}\\) (\\(gC\\)) is computed by the balance between gross primary production \\(GPP_{ind}\\) and respirations \\(R\\): \\[\\begin{equation} NPP_{ind} = GPP_{ind} - R_{maintenance} - R_{growth} \\tag{A.12} \\end{equation}\\] TROLL partitions individuals total leaf area \\(LA\\) into three pools for different leaf age classes corresponding to different photosynthesis efficiency (young, mature and old leaves with \\(LA_{young}\\), \\(LA_{mature}\\), and \\(LA_{old}\\) respectivelly). Consequently we can compute growth primary production for one individual as: \\[\\begin{equation} GPP_{ind} = 189.3 * \\Delta t * \\sum _{l= \\lfloor h-CD \\rfloor +1} ^{\\lfloor h \\rfloor} [A_l] * (\\frac{LA_{young}}{2} + LA_{mature} + \\frac{LA_{old}}{2}) \\tag{A.13} \\end{equation}\\] h and CD are tree height and crown depth, repectivelly (\\(m\\)). \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) is the rounding function. \\(\\Delta t\\) is the duration of a timestep (\\(year\\)). Thus, TROLL can compute carbon allocation to wood into an increment of stem volume \\(\\Delta V\\) (\\(m^3\\)): \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta V = 10^{-6} * \\frac{f_{wood}*NPP_{ind}}{0.5*wsg}*Senesc(dbh) \\tag{A.14} \\end{equation}\\] \\(f_{wood}\\) is the fixed fraction of NPP allocated to stem and branches. \\(wsg\\) is the wood specific gravity (\\(g.cm^{-3}\\), see 1.1). TROLL assume large trees less efficient to convert NPP as growth by using a size-related growth decline with function \\(Senesc\\) after a specific diameter at brest height threshold \\(dbh_{thresh}\\): \\[\\begin{equation} Senesc(dbh) = max(0;3-2*\\frac{dbh}{dbh_{thresh}}) \\tag{A.15} \\end{equation}\\] Finally, TROLL can compute carbon allocation to canopy with canopy NPP fraction denoted \\(f_{canopy}\\) and decomposed into leaf, twig and fruit production. Carbon allocation to leaf results in a new young leaf pool, whereas other leaf pools are updated as follow: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\Delta LA_{young} = \\frac{2*f_{leaves}*NPP_{ind}}{LMA}-\\frac{LA_{young}}{\\tau_{young}} \\\\ \\Delta LA_{mature} = \\frac{LA_{young}}{\\tau_{young}} - \\frac{LA_{mature}}{\\tau_{mature}}\\\\ \\Delta LA_{old} = \\frac{LA_{mature}}{\\tau_{mature}} - \\frac{LA_{old}}{\\tau_{old}} \\end{array} \\tag{A.16} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\tau_{young}\\), \\(\\tau_{mature}\\), and \\(\\tau_{old}\\) are species residence times in each leaf pools (\\(years\\)). The sum of residency time thus defined the leaf lifespan \\(LL = \\tau_{young} + \\tau_{mature} + \\tau_{old}\\) (\\(years\\)). \\(\\tau_{young}\\) is set to one month and \\(\\tau_{mature}\\) is set to a third of leaf lifespan \\(LL\\). Belowground carbon allocation is not simulated inside TROLL. A.5 Tree growth Once the increment of stem volume \\(\\Delta V\\) calculated with equation (A.14), TROLL convert it into an increment of tree diameter at breast height denoted \\(\\Delta dbh\\). TROLL infer tree height from \\(dbh\\) using a Michaelis-Menten equation: \\[\\begin{equation} h = h_{lim}*\\frac{dbh}{dbh + a_h} \\tag{A.17} \\end{equation}\\] On the other hand, we have the trunk volume \\(V = C * \\pi * (\\frac{dbh}{2})^2*h\\), thus: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\Delta V = C*\\frac{1}{2}*\\pi*h*dbh*\\Delta dbh + C * \\pi * (\\frac{dbh}{2})^2*h \\\\ \\Delta V = V*\\frac{\\Delta dbh}{dbh}*(3-\\frac{dbh}{dbh + ah}) \\end{array} \\tag{A.18} \\end{equation}\\] Next, TROLL used the new trunk dimension (\\(dbh\\) and \\(h\\)) to update tree crown geometry using allometric equations (Chave et al. 2005): \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ CR = 0.80 + 10.47*dbh - 3.33*dbh^2\\\\ CD = -0.48 + 0.26*h~;~CD = 0.13 + 0.17*h~(h&lt;5~m) \\end{array} \\tag{A.19} \\end{equation}\\] Finally, TROLL computes the mean leaf density within the crown (\\(LD\\) in \\(m^2.m^{-3}\\)) assuming a uniform distribution: \\[\\begin{equation} LD = \\frac{LA_{young}+LA_{mature}+LA_{old}}{\\pi*CR^2*CD} \\tag{A.20} \\end{equation}\\] A.6 Mortality Mortality is partitioned in three factors inside TROLL: background death \\(d_b\\), treefall death \\(d_t\\) and negative density dependent death \\(d_{NDD}\\). Because density dependent death \\(d_{NDD}\\) is still in development inside TROLL we did not used it, so we will not detail is computation. Chave et al. (2009) advocated for a wood economics spectrum opposing fast growing light wood species species with high risk of mortality to slow growing dense wood species with reduced risk of mortality. Hence, background mortality is derived from wood specific gravity \\(wsg\\) inside TROLL: \\[\\begin{equation} d_b = m*(1-\\frac{wsg}{wsg_{lim}})+d_n \\tag{A.21} \\end{equation}\\] \\(m\\) (\\(events.year^{-1}\\)) is the reference background death rate for lighter wood species (pioneers). \\(d_n\\) represents death by carbohydrates shortage. If the number of consecutive day with \\(NPP_{ind} &lt; 0\\) (A.12) is superior to tree leaf lifespan \\(d_n\\) is set to 1 and remains null in other cases. Mortality by treefall inside TROLL depends on a specifric stochastic threshold \\(\\theta\\): \\[\\begin{equation} \\theta = h_{max}*(1-v_T*|\\zeta|) \\tag{A.22} \\end{equation}\\] \\(h_{max}\\) is the maximal tree height. \\(v_T\\) is the variance term set to 0.3. \\(|\\zeta|\\) is the absolute value of a random centered and scaled Gaussian. If the tree hieght \\(h\\) is superior to \\(\\theta\\) then the tree may fall with a probability \\(1-\\theta/h\\) (Chave 1999). The treefall direction is random (drawn from a uniform law (\\(\\mathcal{U}[0,2\\pi]\\)). All tree in the trajectory of the falling tree will be hurted through a variable denoted \\(hurt\\), incremented by fallen tree height \\(h\\). If a tree height is inferior than its \\(hurt\\) values then it may die with a probability \\(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{h}{hurt}\\). \\(hurt\\) variable is reset to null at each timestep (\\(month\\)). A.7 Recruitment Once the tree became fertile they will start to disperse seeds. TROLL consider tree as fertile after a specific height threshold \\(h_{mature}\\) (Wright et al. 2005): \\[\\begin{equation} h_{mature} = -11.47+0.90*h_{max} \\tag{A.23} \\end{equation}\\] But TROLL is not considering seed directly through a seedbank, instead seed might be interpreted as a seedling recruitment opportunity. The number of reproduction opportunities per mature tree is denoted \\(n_s\\) and set to 10 for all species. This assumption originates from a trade-off between seed number and seed size resulting in equivalent survival and recruitment probability. All \\(n_s\\) events are dispersed with a distance randomly drawn from a Gaussian distribution. Additionally, TROLL model consider external seedrain through \\(n_{ext}\\) events of seed immigration: \\[\\begin{equation} n_{ext} = N_{tot}*f_{reg}*n_{ha} \\tag{A.24} \\end{equation}\\] N_{tot} is the external seedrain per hectare (number of reproduction opportunities). \\(f_{reg}\\) is the species regional frequency. \\(n_{ha}\\) is the simulated plot size in \\(ha\\). Finally, a bank of seedlings to be recruited is defined for each pixel. If the ground-level light reaches a species light compensation point \\(LCP\\) the species will be recruited: \\[\\begin{equation} LCP = \\frac{R_{leaf}}{\\phi} \\tag{A.25} \\end{equation}\\] \\(R_{leaf}\\) is the leaf respiration for maintenance (see (A.10)). \\(\\phi\\) is the quantum yield (\\(\\mu mol C.\\mu mol~photon\\)) set to 0.06. If several species reach their \\(LCP\\), one is picked at random. Seedlings are recruited with following intial geometry: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ dbh = \\frac{a_h}{h_{max} - 1}\\\\ h = 1~m\\\\ CR = 0.5~m\\\\ CD = 0.3~m\\\\ LD = 0.8~m^2.^{-3} \\end{array} \\tag{A.19} \\end{equation}\\] References "],
["appendix-2-leaf-lifespan-model.html", "B Appendix 2: Leaf lifespan model B.1 Material and methods B.2 Results", " B Appendix 2: Leaf lifespan model TROLL model previous implementation encompass Reich’s 1991 and 1997 and Wright’s 2004 allometries to estimate leaf lifespan with (Reich et al. 1991, 1997; Wright et al. 2004). But we have shown that Reich’s allometries are underestimating leaf lifespan for low LMA species. Moreover simulations estimated unrealistically low aboveground biomass for low LMA species. We assumed Reich’s allometries underestimation of leaf lifespan for low LMA species being the source of unrealistically low aboveground biomass inside TROLL simulations. We decided to find a better allometry with Wright et al. (2004) GLOPNET dataset. B.1 Material and methods We compiled functional traits from GLOPNET (Wright et al. 2004), TRY (Kattge et al. 2011), and DRYAD (Chave et al. 2009) databases (see B.1). We kept dataset given by GLOPNET as origin dataset for observations. Dataset defined as origin corresponded to leaf lifespan (\\(LL\\)) and most of the time to leaf mass per area (\\(LMA\\)) and leaf nitrogen content per leaf dry mass (\\(Nmass\\)). We measured variable importance in functionnal traits to explain leaf lifespan with out-of bag method applied on a random forest. Then, we used a béayesian apporach to test different models with growing level of complexity. We retained the model with the best tradeoff between model complexity (number of parameters \\(K\\)), convergence, likelihood, and prediction quality (root mean sqaure error of prediciton \\(RMSEP\\)). We finally tested the new allometry obtained with the selected model with TROLL simulations. Table B.1: Functional traits gathered with TRY.

Finally, wood specific gravity (\\(wsg\\)) add also a significant importance in leaf lifespan estimation. Table B.2: Variable importance calculated with out-of the bag method applied on a random forest. First column represents the mean decrease in mean square error (%IncMSE) whereas second column represents the total decrease in node impurities, measured by the Gini Index (IncNodePurety). Leaf lifespan (LL) is taken in GLOPNET database from Wright et al. (2004). Leaf mass per area (LMA), and leaf nitrogen content (Nmass) are taken both in TRY (https://www.try-db.org) and GLOPNET databases. Wood specific gravity (wsg) is taken both in TRY and DRYAD databases. %IncMSE IncNodePurity LMA 96.11412 2046.155 Nm 158.27071 2681.129 wsg 51.17126 1455.848 The selected model had a maximum likelihood of 13.6 and a RMSEP of 12 months: \\[\\begin{equation} LL_{d} \\sim log\\mathcal{N}({\\beta_1}_d*LMA - {\\beta_2}_d*N*\\beta_3*wsg, \\sigma) \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] Leaf lifespan \\(LL\\) follows a lognormal law with location infered from leaf lifespan \\(LMA\\), nitrogen content \\(N\\) and wood specific gravity \\(wsg\\) and a scale \\(\\sigma\\). Each \\({\\beta_i}_d\\) is following a normal law located on \\(\\beta_i\\) with a scale of \\(\\sigma_i\\). All \\(\\beta_i\\), \\(\\sigma_i\\), and \\(\\sigma\\) are assumed without presemption following a gamma law. \\(d\\) represents the dataset random effects and encompass environmental and protocol variations. Figure B.1: Leaflifespan predictions for the selected model with leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf nitrogen content (Nmass), wood specific gravity (wsg) and predicted versus observed values. Leaf lifespan (LL) is predicted with model M10 fit. Leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf nitrogen content (Nmass), and wood specific gravity (wsg) are taken in a composite dataset of GLOPNET, TRY and DRYAD datasets.Warning LMA (resp. Nmass and wsg) is not constant and depend on the closest point value for right (resp. center and left) graph. Simulations are validating that this new allometry resolve the issue of unrealistically low aboveground biomass for low LMA species due to an early edath of individuals inside simulations. For instance with this allometry Symphonia sp 1 (a low LMA species) is now reaching a realistic aboveground biomass above 400 \\(tonC.ha^{-1}\\) and realistic diameter and age distribution inside the final population.

A first litterature review was completed by an interview with Laurent Descroix of the Office Nationale des Forêts. We discovered that rotten trees were not random and seemed to depend both on tree species and diameter. This document presents modelling of relation between rotten trees and their species and diameter. In fact we have two different questions: Predict if a tree will be probed as rotten (models M) Predict how much of tree volume is rotten (models N) First all M model can be written as follow: \\[Rotten_n \\sim \\mathcal{B}(\\theta_n), ~~n \\in [1,N_{=3816}] ~~ p \\in [1, P_{=8}], ~~ s \\in [1, S_{=43}]\\] Secondly, all N models depend on a latent variable being the percentage of rotten wood \\(Pt_r\\). We can assume that all trees are growing depending on species \\(s\\) and plot \\(p\\) fertility and are supposed to have a full healthy volume \\(V_h\\) for a given diameter \\(dbh\\).
