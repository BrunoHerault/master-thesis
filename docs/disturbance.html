<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Disturbance</h1>
<p>Most tropical timber production originates from selective logging, the targeted harvesting of timber from species of interest. Consequently, tropical sylviculture can be assimilated to a disturbance. The main difference between a disturbance and selective logging is the targetting of both species and individuals of interest. So we decided to first asses unselective disturbance effect on tropical forest ecosystem to subsequently better understand selective logging effect.</p>
<p>We first implemented a disturbance module inside TROLL model to simulate unselective disturbance. 60 tree communities were then defined with different levels of both specific and functional richness to explore the role of biodiversity on tropical forest ecosystem answer to disturbance. Next, different levels of disturbance were simulated on previous mature communities. Finally, resilience of ecosystem major global variables (related to carbon stock, forest dynamic and florisitic structure) from simulations were partitioned between selection effects and niche complementarity <span class="citation">(Loreau &amp; Hector <a href="#ref-Loreau2001">2001</a>)</span>.</p>
<div id="model-description-1" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Model description</h2>
<p>Disturbance module was designed in the simplest way in order to relate the ecosystem answer to volume lost without any individuals nor species targetting. For a given iteration <span class="math inline">\(disturb_{iter}\)</span>, individuals are picked randomly with a uniform law on the number of trees. Selected individuals are then removed without trigerring a treefall to avoid any side effect. The operation is repeated untill the disturbance result in a defined lost basal area (<span class="math inline">\(disturb_{intensity}\)</span> in % of BA).</p>

<div id="design-of-experiment" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Design of experiment</h2>
<p>In order to assess the role of biodiversity in ecosystem answer to disturbance, we needed to create a space of experiments encompassing both variation of disturbance, biodiversity and time. Disturbance was represented by percentage of basal area loss (0%, 25%, 50% and 75%). Biodiversity was integrated with two components specific and functional diversities. We used species richness <span class="math inline">\(SR\)</span> to represents species diversity (5, 25, and 125). Functional diversity can be related to numerous components, and <span class="citation">Perrone <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#ref-Borgy2017">2017</a>)</span> argued for 5: richness, divergence, regularity, overlap and mean. Because mature forest were created from a bare soil with TROLL simulations, we could not control a priori divergence, regularity and overlap but only assess theim before diturbance. Consequently, we focused on functional richness with convex hull volume <span class="math inline">\(CHV\)</span> and functional mean with community weighted mean <span class="math inline">\(CWM\)</span>. For each level of species richness <span class="math inline">\(SR\)</span>, we selected 20 communities with growing convex hull volume <span class="math inline">\(CHV\)</span> but with a community weighted means close to the regional species pool community weighted means. Effectivelly, we did not wanted drastic change in community means that could have more effect than functional richness itself. This design of experiments resulted in 60 communities (<span class="math inline">\(5~SR*20~CHV\)</span>) and 240 simulations (<span class="math inline">\(60 ~communities*4~levels~of~disturbance\)</span>) over 600 years (maturity being assumed after 500 years of regeneration <span class="citation">(Maréchaux &amp; Chave)</span>). Figure <a href="disturbance.html#fig:DOE">4.1</a> presents the design of experiment for communities biodiversity after the forest mature were simulated, and thus before disturbance. We obtained a broad range of both functionl dispersion <span class="math inline">\(FDis\)</span> and aboveground biomass <span class="math inline">\(AGB\)</span> for simulated forest ecosystems before disturbance.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Ecosystem answer anlaysis</h2>
<p>Tropical forest ecosystems provides numerous ecosystem services linked to several ecosystem functions. We focused on few functions and related metrics to analyse ecosystem answer to disturbance: carbon stock with aboveground biomass (<span class="math inline">\(AGB\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(ton~C.ha^{-1}\)</span>), forest dynamic with number of stem above <span class="math inline">\(10~cm\)</span> diameter at breast height (<span class="math inline">\(N10\)</span>), and floristic composition with <strong>?</strong> (<strong>?</strong> in <strong>?</strong>).</p>
<p>The resilience of metrics values post disturbance were assessed through <span class="citation">Henry &amp; Emmanuel Ramirez-Marquez (<a href="#ref-Henry2012">2012</a>)</span> formula:</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:Resilience">\[\begin{equation}
  R\left(t\right)=\frac{Recovery\left(t\right)}{Loss\left(t_d\right)} \approx \frac{X(t)}{X(t_d-1)}
  \tag{4.1}
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>The resilience of the system <span class="math inline">\(R(t)\)</span> at the time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is described by the ratio of recovery <span class="math inline">\(Recovery(t)\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> to loss suffered <span class="math inline">\(Loss(t_d)\)</span> at disturbance time <span class="math inline">\(t_d\)</span>. We transformed the equation in the resilience of the system <span class="math inline">\(R(t)\)</span> at the time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> being the ratio of the ecosystem metric <span class="math inline">\(X(t)\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> to the ecosystem metric before the disturbance happened <span class="math inline">\(X(t_d-1)\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t_d-1\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(X(t_d-1)\)</span> was calculated as the mean of the ecosystem output for 50 last years of the simulation of the mature forest (over 600 years). Then, we calculated for each simulation the recovery time <span class="math inline">\(t_{recovery}\)</span> were the ecosystem reached back its stable state defined as its state before disturbance. But some ecosystem metrics can reach pre disturbance value wihtout revealing ecosystem recovery. For instance, number of stem above <span class="math inline">\(10~cm\)</span> diameter at breast height <span class="math inline">\(N10\)</span> will first decrease due to disturbance. Then <span class="math inline">\(N10\)</span> will exceed its initial value due to new seedlings recruitment before decreasing towards its pre disturbanec value. Consequently, the first time <span class="math inline">\(N10\)</span> reaches back its pre disturbance value can not be considered as the recovery time <span class="math inline">\(t_{recovery}\)</span>. In order to solve this issue, we considered the ecosystem as stable again when its whole set of observed metrics reach their pre disturbance values.</p>
<p>Biodiversity is not only a facet of the experimental design and an ecosystem output through florisitic composition, but also interact on ecosystem functioning and consequently on its answer to disturbance. Biodiversity ecosystem functioning relation can be split in complementarity and selection effect with <span class="citation">Loreau &amp; Hector (<a href="#ref-Loreau2001">2001</a>)</span> partitioning:</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:BiodivPart">\[\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{c}
    NE = X_O - X_E = CE + SE \\
    CE = N* \overline{\Delta RX} \overline{M}\\
    SE = N*cov(\Delta RX,M)
  \end{array}
  \tag{4.2}
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>Biodiversity net effect <span class="math inline">\(NE\)</span> is based on the difference between ecosystem variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> observed value <span class="math inline">\(X_O\)</span> within the community mixture of species and its expected value <span class="math inline">\(X_E\)</span> if species performance were equal to their performance in monocultures. This effect can be partitioned between complementarity effect <span class="math inline">\(CE\)</span>, representing niche partitionning, positive interactions, and resource supply, and selectvie effect <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> due to dominant species pool driving the ecosystem. Both metrics depend on the variation of relative ecosystem variable <span class="math inline">\(\Delta RX\)</span>:</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:DeltaRY">\[\begin{equation}
  \Delta RX_{sp} = \frac{X_{sp}(mixture)}{X_{sp}(monoculture)} - P_{sp}
  \tag{4.3}
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p><span class="math inline">\(X_sp\)</span> is the ecosystem variable value for one species either in mixture <span class="math inline">\(X_{sp}(mixture)\)</span> or in monoculture <span class="math inline">\(X_{sp}(monoculture)\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(P_{sp}\)</span> is the proportion of the species in the mixture represented by species relative abundance. Consequently, <span class="math inline">\(CE\)</span> averages diversity effects of all species presents in the mixture (both negatives and positives). Whereas <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> become positive when dominant species outperform theimselves in mixture than in monoculture, and negative when less dominant species outperform theimselves in mixture than in monoculture <span class="citation">(Tobner <em>et al.</em> <a href="#ref-Tobner2016">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Recovery trajectories of ecosystem variable after disturbance were partitioned between complementarity effect <span class="math inline">\(CE\)</span> and selection effect <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span>. In order to do that, the design of experiment was repeated for each species indivdually representing 652 simulations of monoculture.</p>
